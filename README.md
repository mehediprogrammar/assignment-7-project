# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Add at least 3 Project features?
Ans:
1.User Authentication and Authorization:

Implement a robust user authentication system to ensure that only authorized users can access certain features or data within your project.
Create user roles and permissions to control what actions different types of users can perform.
Use encryption and secure authentication methods to protect user data and login credentials.


2.Real-time Updates and Notifications:

Integrate real-time features such as WebSocket or WebRTC to enable live updates and notifications for users.
Implement features like instant messaging, live commenting, or notifications for changes in data to enhance user engagement and collaboration.
Utilize push notifications for mobile applications to keep users informed even when they are not actively using your app.

3.Data Analytics and Reporting:

Develop a data analytics dashboard to provide users with insights and visualizations of their data.
Implement reporting features that allow users to generate and export custom reports or charts based on their data.
Utilize machine learning and AI algorithms to provide predictive analytics or recommendations based on the data collected.


#Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.?
Certainly! In a React project, you can create a Card and Credit component to display information about a credit card. Below, I'll provide you with an example of how you can manage the state for these components using React's state management techniques:
In this example, we have two components, Card and Credit, each with its own state managed using the useState hook. The state variables hold the data related to the credit card information and credit amount. We also have functions to handle changes in the input fields and update the state accordingly.

These components can be used in a larger React application to manage and display credit card information and credit amounts, and the state is updated in response to user input.
